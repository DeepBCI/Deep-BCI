[Source_Free_Subject_Adaptation_for_EEG]

* Programming Language: Python
* Contact: P. Lee (lph1114@yonsei.ac.kr)
* Function: We provide a source-free subject adaptation framework for EEG-based visual recognition. For source-free adaptation, this framework contains three stages: the source model training, the generator training, and the target model adaptation.
* Dataset: We utilize the dataset collected by the paper "Deep Learning Human Mind for Automated Visual Classification". (https://tinyurl.com/eeg-visual-classification) To run the codebase, download and place the 'eeg_signals_raw_with_mean_std.pth' in the '/dataset' folder.
