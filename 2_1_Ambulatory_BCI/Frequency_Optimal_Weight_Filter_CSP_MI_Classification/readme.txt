<Frequency optimal_weight_filter_for_CSP>

* Programming Language: MATLAB
* Contact: Y.K. Park (shoutme1@korea.ac.kr)
* Function: This algorithm is motor imagery (MI) analysis using frequecy optimized weight filter. We obtain optimal frequency weigth filter for each channel to improve the motor imagery classification of CSP.
